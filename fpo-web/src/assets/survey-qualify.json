A Peace Bond can do everything a Provincial Court Family Law Protection Order can do. A Peace Bond can also protect your property.\n<br>\n<br>\nTo get a Peace Bond, you will need to tell your story to the police or the RCMP. The police may decide to tell your story to Crown Counsel. Crown Counsel will then decide if a judge is likely to make your Protection Order. Your ex-partner will have an opportunity to tell their story. You may be called as witness.\n<br>\n<br>\nTo apply for a Family Law Protection Order, you will need to tell your story in person to a judge in Family Court. You can apply on your own or you can hire a lawyer to help. A judge may decide to make your Protection Order without your ex-partner needing to be in court.\n<br>\n<br>\nYou can also apply for both Protection Orders at the same time. \n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.lss.bc.ca/resources/pdfs/pubs/For-Your-Protection-eng.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Click here for more information about the differences between a Peace Bond and a Provincial Court Family Law Protection Order.</a>\n<br>\n<br>\nConfirm that you want to apply for a Provincial Court Family Law Protection Order.",
